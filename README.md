Implement data visualization techniques and plots using Python libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to tell a stimulating story

Create different types of charts and plots such as line, area, histograms, bar, pie, box, scatter, and bubble

Create advanced visualizations such as waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, maps with markers, & choropleth maps

Generate interactive dashboards containing scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie, and sunburst charts using the Dash framework and Plotly library

# Automobile Sales Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
For the final assignment, i will analyze historical automobile sales data covering periods of recession and non-recession. i will bring my analysis to life using visualization techniques and then display the plots and graphs on dashboards.

## Project Description
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of historical automobile sales data. The primary objective is to compare and contrast sales performance during periods of economic recession and non-recession. The analysis will utilize various data visualization techniques to illustrate key findings and trends. The final visualizations will be displayed on interactive dashboards.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical automobile sales data.
- Identify and compare sales trends during recession and non-recession periods.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to present your findings.
- Create interactive dashboards to display plots and graphs.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical automobile sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Process and clean the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
3. **Data Analysis:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
4. **Visualization:** Use Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create visualizations.
5. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Dash or other dashboard frameworks to display interactive visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Basic plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn:** Advanced statistical visualizations.
- **Plotly:** Interactive visualizations.
- **Dash:** Dashboard creation and deployment.
